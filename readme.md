# Angular 2 / Vue / React

## A comparison of the top JS frameworks of 2017

### To run the project locally:
1. Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed -- you must have version 6.9.0 or higher
2. Clone the project to your local machine
3. In the root directory of your clone, run `npm install`
4. In the same directory, run `npm start`

### If you make changes to a sub-project:
You can either run `npm run build` from the root directory of your clone, or you can run it in just the directory in which you made the changes.  Either way, there shouldn't be any need to restart the server.
